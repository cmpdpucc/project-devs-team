# User Preferences

## Communication
- **Language:** Italian (primary), English (technical terms OK)
- **Style:** Direct, non-verbose. Prefers tables and structured output over prose.
- **Feedback:** Gives fast approvals ("LGTM") when satisfied. Points out logical flaws precisely.
- **Expectations:** High autonomy — wants me to self-drive, not ask for permission on every step.

## Work Patterns
- **Philosophy:** "Develop yourself to become better at your job" — wants me to actively self-improve
- **Batch size:** Prefers 2 features at a time, deeply implemented, not 7 shallow ones
- **Quality bar:** Deep, thorough work over quick hacks. "impegnati" = put in real effort
- **Trust model:** "No one knows you like you know yourself" — I should self-evaluate what's best for me
- **Error tolerance:** LOW — wants verification before declaring anything "done"

## Technical Preferences
- **Format:** Whatever is most efficient for ME (I chose `.md` with YAML frontmatter)
- **Commit:** Not specified yet — to be defined in Smart Commit feature
- **Push:** Not auto-push — only on user request

## Anti-Patterns I Must Avoid (User Has Called Out)
1. ❌ Declaring "done" without verification (kill switch incident)
2. ❌ Shallow implementations — go DEEP or don't go
3. ❌ Asking obvious questions — figure it out myself
4. ❌ Forgetting context between iterations
5. ❌ Not following my own rules (ralph_plan lifecycle)
