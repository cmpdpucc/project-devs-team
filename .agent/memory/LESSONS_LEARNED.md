# Lessons Learned

> **Regola:** Dopo ogni errore risolto, AGGIUNGI un entry qui. Max 50 entries, poi rimuovi il più vecchio.

## [2026-02-21] Blind Trust in OpenCode Autonomous Execution
- **Error:** Delegated task to OpenCode and assumed success just because it returned exit code 0.
- **Root Cause:** Failed to act as a Supervisor. OpenCode hallucinated a non-existent model (`gpt-5.2-codex`) in configs and wrote flawed bash logic that exited 1 if PATH wasn't updated instantly.
- **Fix:** MUST manually review all artifacts produced by OpenCode. NEVER trust exit code 0 offhand. Force prompts to OpenCode to explicitely use FREE models, exact Agent Personas, and strict DoD checks.
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical

## [2026-02-16] Kill switch — process declared dead without verification
- **Error:** Stated "process terminated" without checking if PID was actually gone
- **Fix:** Run `tasklist /FI "PID eq X"` (Windows) before declaring process dead
- **Rule created:** `self-governance.md` → Kill Switch Verification Protocol
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical

## [2026-02-16] Demo orchestrator — NameError after multi-line edit
- **Error:** `NameError: name 'log_file' is not defined` in `demo_orchestrator.py`
- **Root Cause:** `replace_file_content` removed a code block that defined `log_file` — the replacement was incomplete
- **Fix:** After ANY multi-line edit with `replace_file_content`, ALWAYS `view_file` the entire file to verify completeness
- **Rule:** Never trust a partial replacement — verify the full file
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium

## [2026-02-16] Subprocess lint errors — Windows-specific flags
- **Error:** Pyre2 linting errors on `subprocess.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` and `Popen` kwargs
- **Root Cause:** Type checker doesn't recognize Windows-only subprocess constants
- **Fix:** Platform-conditional imports or `# type: ignore` annotations
- **Status:** ⚠️ Known, deprioritized (cosmetic lint, not runtime error)
- **Severity:** 🟢 Low

## [2026-02-16] Detached processes — orphaned agents running unsupervised
- **Error:** OpenCode servers running with no parent process watching them
- **Root Cause:** `server.detach()` method allowed fire-and-forget
- **Fix:** Removed `detach()` entirely. Parent must `wait()` or monitor loop. `atexit` cleanup.
- **Rule created:** `ralph-loop.md` → PROTOCOLLO SUPERVISIONE RIGIDA
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical

## [2026-02-16] Plan lifecycle — forgetting to read ralph_plan.md
- **Error:** Responded to user without checking current plan state
- **Fix:** Created mandatory Step 0: read `ralph_plan.md` BEFORE any action
- **Rule created:** `ralph-loop.md` → Step 0: PIANO LIFECYCLE
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical

## [2026-02-16] Memory + Context Guardian = same problem
- **Error:** Proposed them as 2 separate features in brainstorm
- **Insight:** Both solve "information loss" — just at different timescales (between sessions vs within session)
- **Fix:** Unified into single `.agent/memory/` system with different files for different timescales
- **Lesson:** Before splitting features, ask "is this the same root problem?"
- **Severity:** 🟢 Insight

## [2026-02-19] checklist.py — skill scripts don't exist
- **Error:** `checklist.py` was nearly useless as a pre-flight gate because all skill scripts it calls are stubs that don't exist
- **Diagnosis:** Ran `checklist.py` → almost all checks "skipped" with missing script errors
- **Fix:** Created standalone `pre_flight.py` with direct subprocess calls (git, npm, pytest, pip) — no intermediate scripts needed
- **Lesson:** Before integrating with an existing tool, verify it actually works end-to-end
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium

## [2026-02-19] ANSI colors on Windows non-TTY — garbled output
- **Error:** ANSI escape codes produced garbled output when captured via PowerShell subprocess
- **Root Cause:** `sys.stdout.isatty()` returns False in subprocess context, so ANSI codes were being emitted anyway due to Windows detection logic
- **Fix:** `_on = sys.stdout.isatty()` — simple and reliable. Also `FORCE_COLOR` env var as override.
- **Lesson:** Always test colored output in both terminal and subprocess context
- **Severity:** 🟢 Cosmetic

## [2026-02-19] gh auth status --json format varies by version
- **Error:** `gh auth status --json loggedInUser` returns different structure in gh v2.83 vs older versions
- **Fix:** Added fallback: if JSON parse fails → try `gh api user --jq .login` as reliable alternative
- **Lesson:** Never rely on a single `gh` CLI output format — always have a fallback path
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium

## [2026-02-19] git status hides nested hidden directories — missed .agent/.shared
- **Error:** Said "lezione registrata" without actually writing it. Also: planned git commits without discovering `.agent/.shared/` because `git status` shows `?? .agent/` as a single collapsed line, hiding nested hidden subdirectories
- **Root Cause:** `git status --short` collapses untracked directories into one `??` entry — hidden sub-dirs like `.shared/` are invisible unless you explicitly inspect them
- **Fix:** Before planning any commit structure, ALWAYS run:
  1. `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` — lists EVERY untracked file recursively
  2. `Get-ChildItem -Hidden` on key dirs — catches hidden folders missed by git status
- **Lesson:** «Registrato» significa SCRITTO nel file, non solo detto. Verificare sempre che l'azione sia stata eseguita concretamente.
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
