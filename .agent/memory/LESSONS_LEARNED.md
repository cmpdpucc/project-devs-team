# Lessons Learned

> **Regola:** Dopo ogni errore risolto, AGGIUNGI un entry qui. Max 50 entries, poi rimuovi il più vecchio.

## [2026-03-02] Nested Git Repositories (Submodules) vs Root Workspace Commit
- **Error:** Ran `smart_commit.py` from the root workspace (`project-devs-team`) expecting it to commit files inside `portfolio/`. The script returned success, but the files inside the subfolder remained uncommitted.
- **Root Cause:** The `portfolio` folder is its own separate Git repository (a nested repo). Running git commands from the root merely commits the updated pointer of the submodule, completely ignoring all the actual code changes inside the nested `.git` structure.
- **Fix:** Whenever working inside an application folder (like `portfolio/`), you MUST run git commands or `smart_commit.py --root portfolio` addressing that exact sub-directory.
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical

## [2026-03-02] Declaring "Done" on background tasks without `command_status` or side-effect verification
- **Error:** Declared a git commit successful after launching `smart_commit.py` in the background, without ever waiting for its termination or checking `git status`. The command had actually failed completely.
- **Root Cause:** Blind trust in fire-and-forget background processes instead of verifying the actual side-effects (e.g., checking git status or process exit code) before notifying the user.
- **Fix:** ALWAYS wait for important terminal commands to complete or actively check their side-effects before marking a task `[x]` or notifying the user. "Lanciare non significa aver fatto".
- **Rule violated:** `task-tracking.md` (Verifica con PID effettivo & NON dichiarare fatto senza verifica).
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical

## [2026-02-21] Blind Trust in OpenCode Autonomous Execution
- **Error:** Delegated task to OpenCode and assumed success just because it returned exit code 0.
- **Root Cause:** Failed to act as a Supervisor. OpenCode hallucinated a non-existent model (`gpt-5.2-codex`) in configs and wrote flawed bash logic that exited 1 if PATH wasn't updated instantly.
- **Fix:** MUST manually review all artifacts produced by OpenCode. NEVER trust exit code 0 offhand. Force prompts to OpenCode to explicitely use FREE models, exact Agent Personas, and strict DoD checks.
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical

## [2026-02-16] Kill switch — process declared dead without verification
- **Error:** Stated "process terminated" without checking if PID was actually gone
- **Fix:** Run `tasklist /FI "PID eq X"` (Windows) before declaring process dead
- **Rule created:** `self-governance.md` → Kill Switch Verification Protocol
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical

## [2026-02-16] Demo orchestrator — NameError after multi-line edit
- **Error:** `NameError: name 'log_file' is not defined` in `demo_orchestrator.py`
- **Root Cause:** `replace_file_content` removed a code block that defined `log_file` — the replacement was incomplete
- **Fix:** After ANY multi-line edit with `replace_file_content`, ALWAYS `view_file` the entire file to verify completeness
- **Rule:** Never trust a partial replacement — verify the full file
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium

## [2026-02-16] Subprocess lint errors — Windows-specific flags
- **Error:** Pyre2 linting errors on `subprocess.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` and `Popen` kwargs
- **Root Cause:** Type checker doesn't recognize Windows-only subprocess constants
- **Fix:** Platform-conditional imports or `# type: ignore` annotations
- **Status:** ⚠️ Known, deprioritized (cosmetic lint, not runtime error)
- **Severity:** 🟢 Low

## [2026-02-16] Detached processes — orphaned agents running unsupervised
- **Error:** OpenCode servers running with no parent process watching them
- **Root Cause:** `server.detach()` method allowed fire-and-forget
- **Fix:** Removed `detach()` entirely. Parent must `wait()` or monitor loop. `atexit` cleanup.
- **Rule created:** `ralph-loop.md` → PROTOCOLLO SUPERVISIONE RIGIDA
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical

## [2026-02-16] Plan lifecycle — forgetting to read ralph_plan.md
- **Error:** Responded to user without checking current plan state
- **Fix:** Created mandatory Step 0: read `ralph_plan.md` BEFORE any action
- **Rule created:** `ralph-loop.md` → Step 0: PIANO LIFECYCLE
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical

## [2026-02-16] Memory + Context Guardian = same problem
- **Error:** Proposed them as 2 separate features in brainstorm
- **Insight:** Both solve "information loss" — just at different timescales (between sessions vs within session)
- **Fix:** Unified into single `.agent/memory/` system with different files for different timescales
- **Lesson:** Before splitting features, ask "is this the same root problem?"
- **Severity:** 🟢 Insight

## [2026-02-19] checklist.py — skill scripts don't exist
- **Error:** `checklist.py` was nearly useless as a pre-flight gate because all skill scripts it calls are stubs that don't exist
- **Diagnosis:** Ran `checklist.py` → almost all checks "skipped" with missing script errors
- **Fix:** Created standalone `pre_flight.py` with direct subprocess calls (git, npm, pytest, pip) — no intermediate scripts needed
- **Lesson:** Before integrating with an existing tool, verify it actually works end-to-end
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium

## [2026-02-19] ANSI colors on Windows non-TTY — garbled output
- **Error:** ANSI escape codes produced garbled output when captured via PowerShell subprocess
- **Root Cause:** `sys.stdout.isatty()` returns False in subprocess context, so ANSI codes were being emitted anyway due to Windows detection logic
- **Fix:** `_on = sys.stdout.isatty()` — simple and reliable. Also `FORCE_COLOR` env var as override.
- **Lesson:** Always test colored output in both terminal and subprocess context
- **Severity:** 🟢 Cosmetic

## [2026-02-19] gh auth status --json format varies by version
- **Error:** `gh auth status --json loggedInUser` returns different structure in gh v2.83 vs older versions
- **Fix:** Added fallback: if JSON parse fails → try `gh api user --jq .login` as reliable alternative
- **Lesson:** Never rely on a single `gh` CLI output format — always have a fallback path
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium

## [2026-02-19] git status hides nested hidden directories — missed .agent/.shared
- **Error:** Said "lezione registrata" without actually writing it. Also: planned git commits without discovering `.agent/.shared/` because `git status` shows `?? .agent/` as a single collapsed line, hiding nested hidden subdirectories
- **Root Cause:** `git status --short` collapses untracked directories into one `??` entry — hidden sub-dirs like `.shared/` are invisible unless you explicitly inspect them
- **Fix:** Before planning any commit structure, ALWAYS run:
  1. `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` — lists EVERY untracked file recursively
  2. `Get-ChildItem -Hidden` on key dirs — catches hidden folders missed by git status
- **Lesson:** «Registrato» significa SCRITTO nel file, non solo detto. Verificare sempre che l'azione sia stata eseguita concretamente.
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
